# RNN Large Text Generator
This project is a practice for RNN and text generating algorithms. The algorith does not have any logical confirmartion of the generated text it solely depend on the recurrence of the text. The training data is chosen with sliding a window accross the dataset so the previous text has an affect on created one. Further more this algorith does not create a meaningful text instead act like a parrot and try to mimic the training dataset.
#Dataset
Dataset used for this projet is tensorflow shakespeare.txt which contain all of the Shakespeare works.
